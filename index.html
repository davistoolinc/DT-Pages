                <h2>Who We Are.</h2>
                <p>In 1994 Neal and Penny Davis opened Davis Tool Inc., designing and building intricate injection molds and dies.  Over the years, our multi-generational company has expanded its team and capabilities to include plastic injection molding, metal and ceramic injection molding (MIM and CIM), sintering,  and small tonnage stamping.</p>
                <p>Our mission has been to treat others how we would like to be treated by providing personal, on-time service, and good value.  Our hard-working and cohesive team works closely with our customers, acting as an extension of their business in order to fulfill or exceed their needs and expectations.</p>  
                <p>Over 29 years later, the name of our company is still a statement that the work done here is worthy of our family's reputation.</p>
